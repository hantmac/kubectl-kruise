# kubectl-kruise
kubectl plugin for OpenKruise

`kubectl` supports a plug-in mechanism, but the rollout and other related operations provided by this tool itself only support the native workload resources of Kubernetes.
Therefore, we need to create a kubectl plugin for OpenKruise, through which community users can use kubectl to operate Kruiseâ€™s workload resources.

So, `kubectl-kruise` was created.

### How to use
The development of  `kubectl-kruise`  is in progress, if you wanna to experience it, you can clone it and make it:

```
make build && cp kubectl-kruise /usr/local/bin

```

Then you can operate Openkruise resource by `kubectl-kruise`.
By now the `rollout undo`, `rollout status`, `rollout history` has been developed.
